  This analysis investigates the Texas Department of Public Safety's (TDPS) Border Report data (2017–2023) to understand accessibility, completeness, and trends. This work was inspired by ProPublica’s [investigation](https://www.propublica.org/article/texas-governor-brags-about-his-border-initiative-the-data-doesnt-back-him-up) into the U.S./Mexico border crisis and controversies around Operation Lone Star.
  
  #### Key highlights:

  - TDPS Border Report data is hard to access and requires advanced skills to analyze.
  - Only 49% of the data is complete, with many agencies struggling to adopt the FBI's new National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS).
  - Larceny-theft and assault dominate reported crimes, while human trafficking appears to be severely underreported.
  - Data gaps and reporting inconsistencies limit conclusions about border conditions.

tools_used:
  - Python (pandas, numpy geopandas, shapely)
  - seaborn, matplotlib for data visualization
